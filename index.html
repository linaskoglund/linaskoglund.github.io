                I'm a fifth year PhD candidate in comparative politics working on resistance to the state, rural resentment, and backlash against environmental policy with a regional focus on France. My dissertation examines the relationship between centralization and local rebellion using both historical and contemporary cases. I use quasi-natural experiments to understand how place-based grievances shape attitudes towards the state.

	      <div id="paper1" style="display:none;"><br> This paper exploits a quasi-natural experiment based on temporal variations in the geographic spread of bears and wolves in France since the 1990s 
                  as the result of wildlife policies to study how exposure to the negative externalities of state decisions affeect local
politics. First, I examine how exposure to costs of state decisions that are unevenly
geographically distributed affect turnout in national elections at the municipal level. Then,
my goal is to compare the intensity and nature of backlash against the state depending on
the spatial spread of the costs. Due to specie-specific traits, the costs incurred by the return
of wolves are distributed across locations dispersed throughout Eastern France whereas
locations a↵ected by bears are clustered within a small mountainous area. Wildlife policy
allows me to study the role of space on mobilization by keeping costs, actors, context
and the type of grievance constant. My independent variable of interest - the spatial
distribution of locations affeected by a policy- is the only one to vary. Preliminary results
suggest that, overall, exposure to costs is associated with an increase in turnout in national
elections. Second, I present some evidence that clustered costs lead to more intense and
violent forms of mobilization than dispersed costs.  </div>

		<div id="paper2" style="display:none;"><br> How do communication technologies shape the diffusion of social unrest in the context of political uncertainty? Most of the scholarship examining the effect of communication technology on mobilization focuses on the capacity of challengers to solve the coordination problem. In this paper, I show that technology also affects the exercise of repression. I exploit quasi-random variations in connections between local agents and Paris during Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte's coup in December 1851. Most agents communicated with Paris by the Chappe optical telegraph, a technology that could not function when visibility was low (fog, rain, snow, nightime). I posit that breakdowns in communications prevented the rapid allocation of scarce repressive resources and increased the uncertainty of local agents regarding the success of the coup. I geocode the full record of the repression of the anti-coup uprising (25 000 individual court files) and digitize all time-stamped telegraphic communications between local agents and coup plotters in Paris during the coup (1300 dispatches). I show that weaker connections with Paris resulted in higher levels of mobilization at the canton level.
