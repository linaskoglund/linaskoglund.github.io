                    Voices in the wilderness? The spatial distribution of the costs of environmental policy and anti-state mobilization<br/>
                  
                  This paper exploits a quasi-natural experiment based on temporal variations in the geographic spread of bears and wolves in France since the 1990s 
                  as the result of wildlife 
                  policies to study how exposure to the negative externalities of state decisions a畫ct local
politics. First, I want to examine how exposure to costs of state decisions that are unevenly
geographically distributed a畫ct turnout in national elections at the municipal level. Then,
my goal is to compare the intensity and nature of backlash against the state depending on
the spatial spread of the costs. Due to specie-specific traits, the costs incurred by the return
of wolves are distributed across locations dispersed throughout Eastern France whereas
locations a畫cted by bears are clustered within a small mountainous area. Wildlife policy
allows me to study the role of space on mobilization by keeping costs, actors, context
and the type of grievance constant. My independent variable of interest - the spatial
distribution of locations a畫cted by a policy- is the only one to vary. Preliminary results
suggest that, overall, exposure to costs is associated with an increase in turnout in national
elections. Second, I present some evidence that clustered costs lead to more intense and
violent forms of mobilization than dispersed costs.
