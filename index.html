		Hi! I am currently a Prize Fellow in Economics, History and Politics (2025-2028) at the Center for History and Economics at Harvard University and a PhD candidate in Comparative Politics at Princeton University.

My job market paper examines the role of information during regime takeovers. The article uses a natural experiment based on Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte's coup in 1851 France and shows that the coup plotters' control over information flows during the coup enabled the swift transition to autocracy by deterring the coordination of the opposition. 
     <br> <br>	

In addition, my book project, <em>Voices in the Wilderness</em>, explores local mobilization against wildlife policy and examines how exposure to environmental policies affects perceptions of the state in rural France.

	<div id="The Revolution Will Not Be Telegraphed" style="display:none; text-align: justify;"><br> How to successfully execute a coup? In this paper, I highlight the strategic importance of control over means of communications to deter the coordination of anti-coup challengers during the period of uncertainty that follows the beginning of a takeover attempt. Based on Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte’s coup in December 1851 that caused the breakdown of the Second Republic (1848-1851), I examine the effect of quasi-random interruptions in telegraphic communications between coup-plotters in Paris and bureaucrats (prefects) in the rest of France on the local size of anti-coup insurgency. I collected and digitized the full record of all time-stamped telegraphic dispatches exchanged during the coup (+4000 dispatches). This rich dataset allows an hour-by-hour examination of the effects of uncertainty on mobilization. I demonstrate that when the conspirators controlled information flows, they could prevent the rise of pro-democracy dissent and clear the path towards autocracy. By contrast, when communications with Paris were interrupted, local bureaucrats remained uncertain and stayed passive while mass unrest grew jeopardizing the success of the coup. The study examines the determinants of the largest provincial uprising in 19th century France and shows that, at this particular historical juncture of mass politicization and state modernization, centralized communication technology enabled the state to crush society, establishing Paris as the center of politics.

			This paper examines the role of surveillance in the establishment and consolidation of authoritarian regimes, with a focus on the emergence of modern policing under Joseph Fouché, Napoleon’s notorious Minister of Police. The political police play a dual role in the survival of authoritarian rule: they monitor weak signals to preempt emerging threats, and cultivate an illusion of omnipresence that disciplines behavior. This study emphasizes a third, often overlooked function critical to regime consolidation: cooptation. By turning potential dissidents into informants—often in exchange for leniency—the regime extends its reach and gradually dismantles opposition from within. Drawing on the Bulletins quotidiens adressés par Fouché à l'Empereur—a unique archive of daily police reports from 1804 to 1810—the article highlights how blackmailing dissidents into acting as snitches of the regime is key in the transition towards autocracy. Using supervised and unsupervised language models on nearly 20,000 reported events in the police files, the study examines the strategic expansion of information networks and reveals how infiltration is a key instrument of regime transition.

		<li>When Modernization Backfires: understanding the determinants of the unlikely alliance of local landed elites and the rural poor
against the central state in XIXth century France

		<div id="Getting on like a house on fire" style="display:none; text-align: justify;"><br> 
			In this paper, I show that the type of resistance to state intervention depends on
the economic interests of local elites. I examine the case of the plantation of the Forest of the Landes de
Gascogne decided in 1857 by the French government to enhance land productivity in a large swamp in the
south-west of France where property rights were never clearly delineated after the French Revolution. The
policy provoked a sudden change in the type of terrain and a radical shift in the nature of property regimes.
The paper shows that that where local elites appropriated the commons, the rural poor and landowners
entered a bargain to mitigate the economic consequences of privatization and coordinated against state
intervention through latent noncompliance. Where land was bought by outsider capitalists, elites did not
act as mediators and sought state repression to enforce their property rights. There, lower classes actively
resisted the policy through arson attacks against the plantations, illegally freeing grazing land. I collected
data on the structure of land ownership and the prevalence of forest fires at the municipal level for the
second half of the nineteenth century at departmental archives in France.

	      <div id="paper2" style="display:none; text-align: justify;"><br> How do new regimes select bureaucrats? After a coup or revolution, a new regime must allocate civil servant positions to build a bureaucracy that is both competent and loyal. However, post-transition, the ruler faces a dilemma: administrative experience is concentrated among incumbent bureaucrats of the previous regime, whose willingness to subordinate to the new ruler is unknown, while the new regime’s supporters exhibit maximal loyalty but usually possess minimal administrative experience. I argue that the size of the supporter base who participated to the transition and the type of transition determine the scope and patterns of bureaucratic turnover. Using a comprehensive dataset of all individual prefect appointments across nineteenth-century France - a period characterized by frequent, sudden and radical political upheavals - I show that broad democratic transitions produce sweeping purges driven by intra-party competition, resulting in less experienced and unstable bureaucracies. In contract, narrow autocratic takeovers favor selective cooptation of elites of the previous regime (girouettes opportunists). Crucially, I provide evidence that bureaucracies dominated by opportunists moderated autocratic regimes' partisan impulses, prioritizing administrative performance over factional loyalty and preventing complete capture of the state by the ruler's inner circle. These findings help solve a historical puzzle: how did France achieve steady state consolidation despite relentless political instability? I argue that the answer lies in bureaucratic continuity amid political ruptures. While regimes rose and fell, the centralized prefectoral system established in 1800 remained intact, creating durable career incentives for elites to realign across transitions. Opportunism powered French state development. Regimes collapsed, but elites survived, and, in surviving, they provided the foundations of the modern bureaucratic state.  </div>

	      <div id="paper1" style="display:none; text-align: justify;"><br> How does the geographic divide between the winners and losers of environmental policies affect backlash? Using a natural experiment based on wildlife policies protecting large carnivores in France since the mid-1990s, this study explores how the geographic scope of programs targeting wolves and bears influences political mobilization. At the micro-level, the analysis suggests that exposure to both policies leads to higher voter turnout in local elections at the municipal level, though no single party appears to benefit from this increase in participation. At the macro-level, the findings show that the geographic spread of each species led to different forms of resistance. Due to biological habitat-preferences, bears remain within a fixed mountainous area, while wolves colonize new territories. I show that the anti-bear movement has become much stronger and sustained than the anti-wolf movement. In contrast, at the national level, members of parliament have generally supported new bear releases while opposing wolf protection efforts. Since direct and indirect costs of both policies were generously compensated, the study highlights that symbolic costs—such as perceptions of relative deprivation—play a crucial role in explaining the backlash to environmental policies with localized impact.  </div>
